          How long does the Jr Developer Class run,
          and what is the schedule?
        </h3>
        <p>The Junior developer class is twelve weeks
         of instruction, with a two week break. Class
         dates are Tuesday - Saturday November 4th -
         December 20 and January 6 - February 14. Core
         class times are Tuesdays - Fridays 1pm - 8pm
         and Saturdays 10am - 1pm. If you can't make
         all the core class times, alternate arrangements
         can be made.</p>
        <h3>
          What can I expect at Jr Developer Class, and
          how will that help me become a good jr developer?
        </h3>
        <p>We cover core python, and important developer practices
          like source control, testing, and debugging. Pair programming
          and group work, as well as personal portfolio projects help
          round you out as a developer. We'll also help prepare you to
          get a job, with resume and interviewing coursework as well.</p>
        <h3>
          How much does the Jr Developer Class cost? Can I make payments?
        </h3>
        <p>Tuition for the Junior developer class is $2850. Tuition can be
          broken up into three payments of $950 each. We offer a
          5% discount for tuition paid in full before before the
          first day of class.</p>
        <h3>
          How do I apply?
        </h3>
        <p>Everyone who applies is unique, and we feel a face-to-face
          conversation is the best way we can get to know each other. To
          set an appointment, either <a href="contact.html">contact us</a>
          directly or use or use the

        <h3>
          How long does the individualized career development program run?</h3>
        <p>As long as you need. For many people expect 4-6 months. The
          program is a continuous rolling cohort of people from different
          backgrounds, who are seeking different goals. For this reason
          our program is designed to support your learning wherever you
          are currently at. If you only want a taste of what development
          is like, a month may be enough. For most people they want to
          learn enough to become solid junior developers, and turn that
          into a career. In practice we expect most beginners (who vary
          in experience) to take around 4-6 months to reach their goal of
          getting a job programming. Every situation is unique though, so
          please, <a href="contact.html">contact us</a> so we can talk
          about your unique circumstances.</p>
        <h3>
          When is the individualized career development
           instruction? What days and times?
         </h3>
        <p>You create your own schedule. We organize the week into blocks,
          and you choose the blocks that work for you. It can be weekdays,
          nights and weekend, or any combination that fits your life. You
          can see our block schedule on our
          <a href="value.html">Value and Pricing</a>
          page.</p>
        <h3>
          When does it start?
        </h3>
        <p>We enroll new students each month and run a rolling cohort
          where new students join and other students graduate on their
          own schedule. Because the instruction is individualized, new
          students start as soon as they are ready.</p>
        <h3>
          What does it cost?
        </h3>
        <p>We have flexible plans that accommodate your needs. Our rates
          our monthly. See our
          <a href="value.html">Value and Pricing</a>
          page for details.
        </p>
        <h3>
          What languages are you teaching?
        </h3>
        <p>We're teaching what you want to know. Our instructors have a
          broad background including most common languages, but we can help
          you learn any language that you feel is important. Some common
          choices are the web front end with HTML, CSS, and Javascript
          (with jQuery), a web back end like Ruby on Rails, or Python
          with Django, lower level languages like C and C++, and business
          languages like C# and Java. We have expertise in all of the
          above. You should
          <a href="contact.html">contact us</a>
          to discuss what possibilities are right for you.</p>
